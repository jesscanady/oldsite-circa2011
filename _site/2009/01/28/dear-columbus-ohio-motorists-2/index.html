			<p>I'm harsh on you sometimes, so I thought it should be said:</p>

<p>If the city looks like a powdered donut, and when you're driving on the freeway you <em>can't see the lane lines</em>, it's perfectly fine to drive 20 MPH.  In fact, it's the responsible way to drive, so good on you.</p>

<p>To the guy doing 50 MPH in the fast lane when the rest of the freeway was taking it nice and slow: I hope you know what your truck can and can't handle.  If not, my Dad owns Auto Damage Appraisers of Ohio, feel free to call.</p>
