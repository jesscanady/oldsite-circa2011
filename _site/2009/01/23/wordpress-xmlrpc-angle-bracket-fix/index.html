			<p><strong>Update:</strong> Thanks to <strong>hoystory</strong>, who pointed out that I flubbed the "apply patch" command.  This is what happens when you attempt to post things past your bedtime, folks.  The corrected command is below.</p>

<p>I kept running into problems with the previous post: I was posting through TextMate (over XMLRPC) and every time I tried to post a &lt;pre&gt; tag (for use with the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-syntax/">wp-syntax plugin</a>) the angle-brackets were being stripped out.  This only occurs when posting through the XMLRPC interface, which means posting with third-party editors is hosed.</p>

<p>Turns out that Wordpress and libxml2 aren't <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7771">playing well together</a>: the blame seems to be on libxml2, but regardless the dude over at <a href="http://blog.hoofoo.net/">HooFoo</a> wrote up a <a href="http://blog.hoofoo.net/2009/01/14/wordpress-patch-for-problamatic-libxml2-version/">quick fix</a>.  Two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>It's not an actual patch, just a chunk of code you paste in before some function calls.  <del>I could make a patch, but I'm lazy.</del> <a href="http://joncanady.com/files/wordpress-xmlrpc.diff">Here's the patch</a> -- I left out the patch to <code>wp-admin/import/blogger.php</code> because I don't need to import from blogger.  This patch is against Wordpress 2.7, just go into your base WP directory and type <code>patch -p0 &lt; wordpress-xmlrpc.diff</code> to apply.</li>
<li>Beware when you're copying the text from his blog: smart-quotes <em>will</em> cause syntax errors if you paste them in as-is. Or you could just use the patch I provide and benefit from my pain.</li>
</ol>
