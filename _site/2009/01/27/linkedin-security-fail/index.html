			<h1>LinkedIn Security Fail</h1>

			<p>One of the core tenets of web application security – though it probably applies elsewhere – is the concept of <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007-A6">information leakage</a>: the best line of defense is to not give the attacker anything to use against you.</p>

<p>Most of the time this is taken to mean things like not showing stack traces when an error occurs (PHP's default config, I'm looking at <em>you</em>).<br/>
</p>

<p>That's not quite the whole story though: for example, if a user logs in incorrectly, don't tell the user which part of their authentication was incorrect!  If a user knows that "admin" isn't a login, they stop attacking that and look elsewhere.  Or vice-versa.</p>

<p><a href="http://linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> gets this half-right.  If you forget your password, you're prompted to enter in the email address on file.  Then, LinkedIn emails you a password reset link and displays the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>If [email] is in our records, we will send a link to reset your password to that address. If you are having problems receiving this link, please contact Customer Service.</p></blockquote>

<p>Damn right!  <em>If</em> we happen to have that guy on record!  But it fails on the other end:</p>

<p><img src="/images/linkedin_fail.png" alt="The email address you entered is not in our records!" title="Yeah...." width="90%" height="90%" /></p>

<p>Like I said, <em>half-right</em>.</p>
