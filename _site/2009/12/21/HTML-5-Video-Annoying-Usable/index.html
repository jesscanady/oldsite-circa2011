			<h1>HTML 5 Video Annoying, Usable Today</h1>
			<h2>Dec 21, 2009</h2>
			
			
			
			<p><a href="http://daringfireball.com">Gruber</a> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/12/html5_video_unusable">suggests</a> that HTML 5 video is "effectively unusable" for the following two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>It doesn't allow poster images.</li>
<li>Both audio and video always auto-buffer instead of waiting for a click.</li>
</ol>


<p>Our hero gets past the first issue with some Javascript hackery, which also fixes the second issue.  So, completely usable before (with a few issues), 100% usable afterwards.</p>

<p>There is the ever-present IE issue -- no version of Internet Explorer as of this writing supports <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> -- but this isn't at all an issue for Gruber.<br/>
</p>

<p>The effective conclusion to Gruber's "effectively unusable" piece is "I used it for my <a href="http://daringfireball.net/misc/2009/12/user_guide_demos">PastryKit video page</a> but I had to use Javascript and create two versions of each video and I don't like that."</p>

<p>Which seems, y'know, <em>usable</em> to me.</p>
