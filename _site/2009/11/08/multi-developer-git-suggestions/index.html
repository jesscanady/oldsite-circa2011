			<p>Git's pretty simple to use when it's just you and your Github repo, but as developers increases, complexity increases.</p>

<h2>Each Developer Has Her Own Branch</h2>

<p>Make each developer on the team maintain their own branch where their changes initially go before being merged into <code>master</code>. Bonus: you can vet new developer's changes before they get pushed into whatever the production branch is.</p>

<p>So, here's what I do:</p>

<pre><code>jonc$ git checkout -b jonc
</code></pre>

<p>Create and switch to the branch <code>jonc</code>.</p>

<pre><code>jonc$ git checkout master
jonc$ git merge jonc
</code></pre>

<p>Merge all the changes from <code>jonc</code> into <code>master</code>
(This, of course, works in reverse, if you need to pull new stuff from <code>master</code> into your personal branch)</p>

<pre><code>jonc$ git push origin jonc:refs/heads/jonc
</code></pre>

<p>Now the <code>jonc</code> branch exists on Github.  Anyone else that wants to check out my work is free to do so:</p>

<pre><code>otherdev$ git checkout --track -b jonc origin/jonc
</code></pre>

<h2>Features Have Their Own Branches</h2>

<p>If a feature is going to take longer than one sitting to completely implement -- including tests -- then it goes in its own branch.  Every time I've excepted this rule I've regretted it later.</p>

<pre><code>jonc$ git checkout -b bugfix_553
</code></pre>

<p>If you're going to be collaborating on something with another developer, create it remotely first, then both of you can push/pull from the get-go.</p>

<pre><code>jonc$ git push origin origin:refs/heads/bugfix_553
</code></pre>

<p>That creates the remote branch, and any developer that wants to start working on it does the following:</p>

<pre><code>jonc$ git fetch origin    
jonc$ git checkout --track -b bugfix_553 origin/bugfix_553
</code></pre>

<p>When you're on the <code>bugfix_553</code> branch, pushes and pulls go to and from there instead of <code>master</code>.  When ready, you merge it into master as usual.  Once you're 100% done with the branch, delete it as normal (<code>git branch -d bugfix_553</code>) and remove it from the server if necessary:</p>

<pre><code>jonc$ git push origin :heads/bugfix_553
</code></pre>

<p>No, that command isn't intuitive in the slightest.</p>

<h2>Production Always Builds</h2>

<p>The production branch should <em>never</em> have code in it that breaks.  Hopefully it's got a good test suite, and with any luck it doesn't incur much technical debt, but at the very least it needs to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run</li>
<li>Produce correct output</li>
</ol>


<p>This means that deployments can happen whenever. Developing directly in the production branch or merging changes prematurely means that if critical bugfixes need to go out <strong>now</strong> you can handle that without having to clean up messes first.</p>

<p>Developers that consistently push bad code into the production branch should be beaten. Having some Continuous Integration process watching that branch isn't a bad idea either.</p>

<p>(I've always used <code>master</code> as the production branch, but use whatever makes you feel good.)</p>
