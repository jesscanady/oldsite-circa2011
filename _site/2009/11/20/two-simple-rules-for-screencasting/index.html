			<p>During the process of trying to figure out what <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> is, I tried to watch the official Compass <a href="http://wiki.github.com/chriseppstein/compass">screencast</a>. This was a mistake. Thinking of writing an introductory screencast for your product? Learn from their mistakes.</p>

<h3>Keep It Short</h3>

<p>No shit, the Compass screencast is <em>an hour long.</em>  The only people who are going to watch that are people with a vested interest in the project, who presumably already know the material.</p>

<p>Keep your screencasts to around five minutes. You aren't  <a href="http://peepcode.com/">PeepCode</a>, and this thing isn't your documentation. If you can't keep a basic explanation of your product/service down to five minutes, you have bigger problems.</p>

<h3>Show, Don't Tell</h3>

<p>Up until about 2:20, the Compass screencast doesn't even change, and it takes another minute before there's any actual content on the screen. If the viewer wanted to read a thorough explanation of your product, they would have read the "about" page.</p>

<p>Start with a brief intro on what your product is, then jump right into the demonstration. Impress the viewer quickly and keep them impressed.</p>

<h3>It's That Simple</h3>

<p>That's all you need for an effective screencast. It's almost a definition: "short" and "demonstration". It's hard to go wrong.</p>
