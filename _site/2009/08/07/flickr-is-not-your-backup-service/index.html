			<p>Dude's Flickr account was compromised, his password changed, and then his account terminated.  <a href="http://notnixon.com/post/158066658/fuck-flickr-support-i-want-this-to-spread-like">He seems upset.</a></p>

<blockquote><p>I want this to spread like wildfire. I want people to know that Flickr, their customer service and overall infrastructure is incredibly disappointing and it needs to be fixed ASAP.</p></blockquote>

<p>...and...</p>

<blockquote><p>There were 3,000+ photos on my Flickr photostream from 2004-present. Thousands and thousands of dollars spent on film and developing were pumped into that account and it vanishes within minutes and it’s been days and still I’ve found no resolution with my case.</p></blockquote>

<li>Flickr is an awesome web app for sharing your photos with the world, but it is <em>not</em> an archival service. Flickr happens to host a load of digital images on its servers as effect of providing these photos to the world, not for the purpose of storing them in perptuity.</li>
<li>Dude spent "thousands and thousands of dollars on film and developing" and  didn't keep local backups of his work? Did he just upload the files to Flickr and then delete them? Come on.</li>
</ol>


<p>On the assumption that he didn't keep backups: <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/backups.html">it's not that hard</a>. If backups are kept, than at most a bunch of metadata was lost, but then the argument isn't "I wasted a bunch of money developing photos that you deleted" but "I spent hundreds of hours tagging and describing and all for nothing" -- that sucks, but that isn't nearly worth this level of bitchitude.</p>
