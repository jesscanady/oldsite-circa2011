			<h1>iPhone Lock Code and iTunes 8.2</h1>

			<p>Installed the iTunes 8.2 update, docked my phone, and saw a new error message:</p>

<p><img src="/images/iphone_sync.png" alt="iTunes 8.2: cannot unlock due to passcode" /></p>

<p>I don't know how to feel about this.  The security-conscious (read: paranoid) part of me thinks it's probably a good idea to not let just anyone do a sync of your locked and protected iPhone.  The lazy jerk part of me that just wants to slap his phone in a dock and have the damn thing sync is a little miffed right now.</p>

<p>I wonder how helpful this really is?  Is the control built into iTunes or the iPhone itself?  Could someone <em>not</em> using iTunes pull a dump down of the iPhone's HDD?</p>
