<p>To the right you can see the utter failure that is my Apple Dual-Link DVI to Mini Display-Port Adapter.<br /></p>

<br />


<p>When Apple sells you a new unibody Macbook Pro, they include <em>no</em> adapters in the box, which means if you want to hook your new laptop up to any existing display, you need to buy an adapter from Apple.  In the vernacular, I consider this a bitch move, but I put up with it because <em>dammit</em> I really like Apple's hardware.<br /></p>

<br />


<p>It took Apple <em>two months</em> from the time I bought the laptop to even <em>begin</em> shipping the Dual-Link DVI adapter that would let me run my 30 display.  Now that I have it, it fails almost daily.  Sometimes the screen just snow-crashes (no joke), sometimes it double-views as shown, and sometimes it just refuses to detect a display at all.  <br /></p>

<br />


<p>So far it's always come through for me with a bit of cable-jiggling at the DVI-to-Adapter point, but <em>really</em> this is just ridiculous.  I say I love Apple hardware, and that's still true, but this amateur-hour bullshit <em>has</em> to stop.</p>
