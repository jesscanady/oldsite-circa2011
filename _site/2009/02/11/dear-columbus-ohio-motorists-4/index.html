			<p>If there is an accident on the side of the freeway – <em>not blocking any lanes</em> – this is not an excuse to slow down to 40.<br/>
</p>

<p><em>Related</em>: Turning on your emergency flashers <em>while</em> driving 40 doesn't excuse it, either.  If you have half of a TV box sticking out of your trunk, we know why you're driving slow, and you probably shouldn't be on the freeway anyway.  Turning your flashers on is just icing on the fail-cake.</p>

<p>Also, to the Honda minivan driving 35 in the fast lane this morning: at what point are you driving along, traffic angrily swerving around you, and you don't realize that maybe you should get into the lanes with the slower traffic?</p>
