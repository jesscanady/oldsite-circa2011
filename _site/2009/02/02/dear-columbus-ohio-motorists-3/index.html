			<p>Turn signals are important!  Unless they were optional on your vehicle, please respect the following rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use them!  Whether changing lanes on the freeway or swinging out of a parking lot, it's usually a safe bet to flick the signal on, even if "it's obvious" which way you were going.  (Corollary: remember to turn them <em>off</em>.)</li>
<li>Don't depend on them: turn signals <em>do not</em> give you the right of way.  They <em>signal</em> other drivers as to your intentions.  Swinging out into the path of oncoming traffic isn't cool.  "But I <em>had</em> my turn signal on!" isn't a valid excuse.</li>
</ol>


<p>To the (few) Columbus Ohio drivers that actually understand how their turn signals work: <em>thank you</em>, you restore my faith that people in this town know how to drive.</p>

<p>Also, to the guy that parked his F-350 in a compact car space and took up 2.5 of them: seriously?  That's a dick move.  I can't be mad at you <em>personally</em> because there are constantly trucks parked in the small spaces next to Nationwide, but <em>still.</em>  Maybe if you weren't driving a large work truck as your daily driver we wouldn't run into this issue, hmm?</p>
