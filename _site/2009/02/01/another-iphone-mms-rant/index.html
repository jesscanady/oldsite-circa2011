			<p>My sister-in-law's boyfriend just got a new HDTV setup and decided to text me a picture of it.  My iPhone failed in the usual way:</p>

<ul>
<li>Instead of his picture, I get a message that directs me to http://viewmymessage.com/1 (Yep, that /1 is important.  No, it doesn't redirect you properly based on your login and password.)  I get an randomly-generated username and a password that's fairly easy to remember.  I can't copy/paste these things.<br/>
</li>
<li>Instead of fucking around with MobileSafari (writing down the username and password so I don't have to switch back and forth between the iPhone's singular running applicaiton), I sit down at my computer and go to the website.</li>
<li>Website demands I use /1 or /2 on the URL, meaning I have to examine the link to see what's what.</li>
<li>Type in credentials, "Failure encountered during view message."</li>
<li>Repeat five times, sixth time actually works.  I get a very tiny photograph.  Hooray.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is my $400 Jesusphone at work.  Sure, I can type like a dream.  I can shake my phone to find a restaurant or wave it around like a lightsaber or SSH into my home server and check on stuff.  But the free Motorola that comes with a Verizon account can send and receive pictures!<br/>
</p>

<p>On any other phone, the procedure is thus:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flip open your phone.  Yay, picture!  Perhaps even save picture locally!</li>
</ul>


<p>There's lots to love about the iPhone, but there's also <em>lots</em> to hate.  And this amateur-hour bullshit regarding MMS that hasn't even been so much as <em>commented on</em> by Apple is just the tip of the iceberg.  Stay tuned for such thrills as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why does my email client suck?</li>
<li>My friends can run two programs at once, why can't I?</li>
<li>I hear background services are cool and useful!</li>
<li>My springboard (home screen) is about as organized as my physical desk (which is to say <em>not at all</em>)</li>
</ul>
